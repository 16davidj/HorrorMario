# HorrorMario
This repository is an incomplete version of a horror rendition for the classic Super Mario Bros. game. Missing is the final
level and cutscene, which are partially complete. In this game, Princess Peach is the main character, and is trying to escape
from the evil Mario. Though created in Unity3D, the camera perspective set makes the game seem 2D, like the classic game. 
There are four different levels, each getting darker as the story progresses.
